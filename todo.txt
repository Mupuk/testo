# OLD TODO LIST
#

# [ ] make the independent platforms run, even when others crash?
# [ ] think about what happens when a breaking Change in syntax happens. We should not update old results? So we can update the test and pretend we never touched it?
# [ ] SECURITY: Make sure same version gets checked out that was previously validated. Race condition. Also make sure pulls.listFiles uses same version. 
# [ ] mac support 
# [ ] label colors
# [ ] assign original owner to issue tracker / Mention him and give him power?

# [x] parse code description if single file
# [x] automated PR for single file 
# [x] JonSaid add date
# [x] close PR update to parse the things
# [x] validate_PR_and_merge_automation
# [x] add broken platform info
# [x] issue mention not working after PR create
# [x] commit the test_result.json, is there any other way around that? we just 
    # use it to track new issues. Maybe we could check the issues history of the test
    # and do the things we need to do, when we see it doesnt have any entries?
# [x] rename PR file to new issue number, so we know which file belongs to what issue
    # make sure it checks if it is a directory. Not sure how well we can handle that case
    # in confidently doing the right thing. If it is just a single file in the commit we know
    # that is the bug.
    # Scan all files, make sure its either a single file in bug dir, or a single folder. 
    # Otherwisse reject with comment.
# [x] rethink needed fields in depth

# [x] run for past 3-5 jai versions
# [x] gather all test date, get it inot actions and do comparisons
# [x] new issure tracker design
# [x] Auto run testsuit on approval of PR to check it actually crashes
# [x] Update issue on test results
#     [x] change state, dates, labels
#     [x] how to map name to issue number? maybe we DO need an id
# [ ] summary tracker design (as txt because of size limitation?)
# [ ] Update summary on test results
#     [ ] link issue number
#     [ ] foldable source code if single file, otherwise link
#     [ ] add 'new' section, if reported at compilerversion (could still bebroken backwards) 
#         or reopen compiler version (!= last encounter, maybe change that?)
#     [ ] column ordering?
#     [ ] recently fixed section (last 2 compiler versions?)
